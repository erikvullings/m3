m3
==

My Movie Manager (m3) is yet another movie manager. Although there are literal hundreds (thousands?) floating around, I felt an urge to create another one. The reason is that most that I have seen are either very bloated, lack features that I need, or are intended for collectors. In my case, I just want an overview of the movies I have on my drive(s) - those are copies of DVDs that I own, of course -, and being able to quickly select and play them, and delete them when I have watched them. 

m3 fills this gap. It uses the freely available TheMovieDB to get access to movie information. It displays the results in a web page.

Technology stack 
================

The application is developed in TypeScript, a superset of Javascript which is compiled to regular Javascript. It uses node.js as the server, and angularjs to develop a Single Page Application.

TODO

* Implement the VLC interface
